# SPT-NRTL database (version 3)

This repository has the uncompressed data of the SPT-NRTL parameters (v3). for a compressed version, use the link provided originally, and the source of the data in this repository. [https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/unM7rbgj2FQPFdy](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/unM7rbgj2FQPFdy)

## Data storage
The data is stored in a file system based on the canonical SMILES of the components. The NRTL parameter of one component are found in:

`[First Charater of SMILES]\[Lenght of SMILES]\[SMILES].csv`

Because this is an online resource, the SMILES are HTML-encoded.
